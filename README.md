- 👋 Hi, I’m @chasingduende
- 👀 I’m a fine art photographer dedicated to actualizing duende through my work and work process.


- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about the history of duende in the arts, in Lorca's writings, and how duende is expressed differently in different geographies. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with models, makeup artists, costumers, directors, and designers for photography studies and projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: find me on instagram @chasingduende.
